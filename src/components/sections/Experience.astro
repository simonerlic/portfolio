          I firmly believe that good software stems from good design, and so, as
          a result, I strive to create beautiful, intuitive, and accessible user
          interfaces, robust and secure backends, and scalable and maintainable
          codebases.

          From around 12 years old, I became fascinated with the idea of being
          able to create my own games, tools, and experiences using software. I
          remember writing "Choose your own adventure" games using Batch scripts
          during computer classes in middle school (when I was definitely
          supposed to be practicing my typing), and then handing out USB sticks
          with the games to my friends.

          In the many years since then, I have continued to learn and grow as a
          developer, using my curiosity and passion to create as a tool to learn
          new technologies and frameworks. I've compiled a list of some of the
          technologies I've worked with in the cards on this page.
