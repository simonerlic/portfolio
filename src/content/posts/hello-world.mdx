Hello world, My name is Simon! I'm a software engineering student at the University of Victoria, specializing in ML and scalability.
I decided to start this blog as a way of documenting my projects, writing my thoughts on new technology, and, honestly, just to have 
a place to write about things I'm interested in. 

<br />

That's all I have right now, but I'm excited to see where this goes.
